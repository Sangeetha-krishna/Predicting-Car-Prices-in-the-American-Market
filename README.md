# Predicting-Car-Prices-in-the-American-Market
A Comprehensive Regression Analysis

This project aims to model car prices in the American market using a comprehensive dataset of automobile features. The analysis includes the following steps:
1. Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for machine learning models.

2. Model Implementation: Five regression algorithms were implemented:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
3. Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This helped identify the most effective model for predicting car prices.

4. Feature Importance Analysis: Using the Random Forest Regressor, the most significant factors influencing car prices were identified and visualized, providing insights into the critical variables.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: The Random Forest model was fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize performance, resulting in improved predictive accuracy.

This analysis not only identified key variables affecting car prices but also provided a robust and well-evaluated model to predict prices in the American automobile market.
